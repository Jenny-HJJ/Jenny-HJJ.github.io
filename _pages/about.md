I’m a PhD student (2020-) in Computer Science at [Shanxi University](https://www.sxu.edu.cn/) advised by Prof. [Ru Li](https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Ru-Li-14829601?_sg=VXNUDhg-exV6GUMTTzZ3UgEBy0zZa6hRgTd8V_oo4GZ0doGm9wp14Vo_rBLhkms1qfdWlJrEIZquUi0). In addition, I am also jointly mentored by [Jeff Z. Pan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=zLDAY8QAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) and [Víctor Gutiérrez Basulto](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=L2eFo5IAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN). I am currently working at [Shanxi Agricultural University](https://www.sxau.edu.cn/). My research interests focus on representation learning for knowledge graph, including graph representation learning, multi-hop logical reasoning.
